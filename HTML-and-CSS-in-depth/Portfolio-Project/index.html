      <h1>Meet the Owner</h1>
      <p>
        The owner, an Austin local, is well known for her jewelry designs.
        Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo. After
        graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond cutting
        and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown, Austin and
        started to grow her business online. Mariana has always managed every
        aspect of the business, from jewelry design to marketing to e-commerce.
        However, she recently hired several artisans to help craft her designs
        and a young employee to help manage the company website and social media
        accounts.
